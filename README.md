# Song-Recognition
The Song Recognition System is a web-based application that allows users to identify songs from short audio clips. The system follows a Shazam-like fingerprinting technique to recognize songs based on frequency peak analysis. It consists of a FastAPI backend for processing audio files and a React frontend for user interaction.
